# karmalack

karmalack is a team karma and quote collector for your slack channels.  It is a bot.

## Overview

Teams have fun exchanges as they communicate over slack channels.  This bot lets people capture quotes and award karma.  The collected stats are puts on a portal for people to browse.

If you run a community, having karmalack available lets people award karma to each other and capture insightful or funny moments for other members to browse.  It is my hope that such a karma system would encourage community members to participate more and get into a healthy karma points competition to learn and explore new things.  For public communities the portal also becomes a way for people to advertise their skills and karma points and may be help find jobs in these communities.
